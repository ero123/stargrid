This repo contains a copy of a project done for CS210 at Stanford University in spring 2020. 
It is the senior Computer Science capstone of Ellen Roper, Eric Singh, Grant Russel, Tyler Yep, and Alex Wang. 

Initially we were working with BMW, as the class was designed as a two-quarter collaboration with real companies. However, 
when the COVID-19 crisis hit in March of 2020, halfway through the course, our ability to work with the Munich-based workers
was compromised as we were scattered across the country. Thus, we decided to pivot our project into what it is now, based on
the idea that as COVID-19 pushes us away, it is ever more important to find ways to connect individuals. We made the choice to 
create a web-based game designed to foster communication and collaboration via socially distant means.

The game is not currently being hosted but it can be played locally following the instructions in the Software Documentation page of the Wiki
